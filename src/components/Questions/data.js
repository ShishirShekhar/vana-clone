    {
        question: "How can I stop my data from being collected by big tech?",
        answer: "With innovative legislation like CCPA (California) and GDPR (Europe), big tech companies are being forced to give users more control of data. On top of that, Vana allows the user to collect a broader range of more valuable data, to bypass and capture the value that big tech would otherwise get."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between active and passive data?",
        answer: "Active data is the information that you submit directly through actions such as taking surveys and quizzes. Passive data is generated as a byproduct of other activities like browsing the internet or listening to music."
